# CSCI200
All my code for class assignments, projects, and exam prep is stored here for future reference so it isn’t scattered across multiple devices.

FP contains a game I made called asteroid survival. I dont think it works anymore and I dont have the time nore care to fix it. I wish I got a screen recording for proof of life at least.
